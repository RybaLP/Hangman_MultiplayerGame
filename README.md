# Hangman Game (WebSockets Practice)

### About the Project
Hangman is a simple word guessing game that I created to practice **WebSocket** technology.
I was inspired by this video tutorial:
[Pasja Informatyki -JavaScript Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FVtiJHFCSU&t=1294s&ab_channel=Pasjainformatyki),
which played a significant role in the early days of my coding journey.

In this project, I focused entirely on the **backend logic and WebSocket communication**, without paying much attention to the frontend part
(I must admit, it's quite poor at the moment, but that is going to change).
The main goal was to understand the core aspects of WebSocket technology.

### ðŸ”§ How to Setup?
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd hangman
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Run the server:
```bash
npm run dev:socket
```
5. Open your browser and visit:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

###  Enjoy the Game!
